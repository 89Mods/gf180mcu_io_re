# gf180mcu_io RE

Reverse-engineered schematics of gf180MCU IO pad cells (currently only gf180mcu_fd_io__bi_24t).

These schematics were created by me by analyzing and reverse engineering the layouts of these cells as they are distributed with the GF180MCUD PDK. Schematics are not 100% accurate and may contain errors.
